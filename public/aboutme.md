Hi, I'm Yuval 👋
I’m a dedicated Computer Science student at Bar Ilan University and Full Stack Developer at Rafael. 
What started in middle school as a mere curiosity, has evolved into a passion for building projects end-to-end - from design and architecture to full deployment.
When I'm not working or studying, you'll find me exploring new technologies, building personal projects, spending time with friends and working out at the gym 🏋
